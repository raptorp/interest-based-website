          The first ducks manufactured weren’t like the ducks we know today. For
          a start they were solid, weighty creatures which, unsurprisingly,
          didn’t float all that well

          The earliest version of a ‘rubber duck’ first appeared in the late
          1800s, when American chemist Charles Goodyear (later of tyre fame)
          invented vulcanised rubber – that’s rubber hardened via a process of
          heating with sulphur, making it pliable, mouldable and, most
          importantly, waterproof.

            Rubber ducks really hit the big time when in 1947, a sculptor called
            Peter Ganine filed a patent for a duck toy that he had created out
            of vinyl. Painted bright yellow and including their famous
            ‘squeaker’, the ducks were reproduced in their thousands and sold
            across the world.

            Then, in 1970, their fame grew to new heights when the song ‘Rubber
            Duckie’ was featured on Sesame Street, sung by everyone’s favourite
            character Ernie. The song was such a hit that it even made it to
            number 11 in the Billboard Charts in 1971.

          ... rubber ducks have been making bath-time play-time for children
          (and grown-ups) around the world. Along with the iconic yellow and
          orange design, variants now exist in their hundreds, from every colour
          imaginable, to ducks masquerading as Romans and Vikings.
