            The world's largest rubber duck was created by artist Florentijn
            Hofman in 2007, measuring 16.5 m × 20 m × 32 m and weighing about
            600 kg. Since then, Hofman has had several giant ducks on display
            all over the world.

            In 2013, China blocked searches for "big yellow duck" because
            Chinese activists were photo-shopping the Rubber Duck sculpture into
            the Tank Man photo of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

          Rubber duck races, also known as derby duck races, have been used as a
          method of fundraising for organizations worldwide. People donate money
          to the organization by sponsoring a duck. At the end of the
          fundraising drive, all of the ducks are dumped into a waterway, with
          the first to float past the finish line winning a prize for its
          sponsor.
